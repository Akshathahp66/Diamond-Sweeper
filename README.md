# Diamond Sweeper
# Problem Statement

The goal of this exercise is to build a game.

The rules of the game are as follows:

1. The game board has 8x8 squares (initially, all represented by question marks)
2. There are 8 diamonds hidden on the board, each diamond behind one of the squares
3. When the user clicks on a square
    -   If the square was hiding a diamond, the diamond appears
    -   Otherwise, the square is opened, and blank
4. The game ends when all diamonds are found. The user's score is the number of squares still left unturned.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2.
